# tu58fs - Filesharing between DEC PDP-11 and modern hardware over TU58 tape emulator

Tu58fs is a tool to share files between a DEC PDP-11 and a modern computer.

The software emulates an TU58 DECtape II, which is controlled by the PDP over serial RS232 line.

The "tape content" appears as plain files in a shared directory, and can be accessed on both sides.

XXDP and RT-11 filesystems are supported.

Written in C, should compile on every Linux platform.
